= Spring Boot and Two DataSources

This project demonstrates how to use two `DataSource` s with Spring Boot. 

It utilizes: 

* Spring Data JPA
* `@Service` layer with `@PersistenceContext` and JPQL
* Flyway migrations for the separate `DataSource` s
* Application properties with YAML
* Thymeleaf
* Unit tests for components

== TODO
* Separate Hibernate properties for each `DataSource`
